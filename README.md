# Minimal-Reconnection-for-Brain-Resilience
Official code for "Minimal Reconnection for Brain Resilience". Models brain network fragmentation (e.g., Alzheimer's) via hub attacks. Proposes ORT-THERAPY-F, a "Giant Component Absorption" heuristic that achieves 100% reconnection. Standard baselines (PA, CN) fail completely (0% repair), while our method is optimal and 36.5% more efficient.
