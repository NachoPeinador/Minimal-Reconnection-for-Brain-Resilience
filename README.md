This repository contains the code, data, and experiments for the research paper "**Minimal Reconnection for Brain Resilience: A Strategic Reconnection Framework (ORT-THERAPY-F) for Damaged Connectomes**".

The project models the progressive fragmentation in neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimer's) as a **targeted attack that prioritizes the vulnerability of 'hubs' (high-connectivity nodes)**.

We propose ORT-THERAPY-F, a computational framework that validates a strategic reconnection heuristic called **'Giant Component Absorption' (GCA)**. We rigorously compare our heuristic (GCA) against two standard link prediction methods: **Preferential Attachment (PA)** and **Common Neighbors (CN)**.

The results demonstrate that, after severe damage fragments the network into **994 components**, ORT-THERAPY-F **completely restores global connectivity** (reducing 993 components). In stark contrast, the baseline strategies (PA and CN) **fail completely (0 components reduced)**, proving ineffective for this reconnection task. Furthermore, ORT-THERAPY-F achieves this restoration using an optimal connection budget (**36.5% fewer connections** than the baselines) and by being computationally faster.

## üéØ Main Contributions
* üß† **Realistic Damage Model:** Simulates neurodegeneration (Alzheimer's) as a **Targeted Hub Attack** (vulnerability of high-connectivity links), rather than random failure.
* üíØ **Deterministic Reliability:** Our method (GCA) achieved a **100%** reconnection success rate (993 out of 993 fragments repaired). Standard baselines (PA and CN) **failed completely (0% success)**.
* üí° **Resource Optimality:** We achieved perfect repair using **36.5% fewer connections** than the baseline strategies, which were given a larger budget and still failed.
* üî¨ **Problem Distinction:** We empirically demonstrate that *densification* strategies (PA, CN) are not *reconnection* strategies (GCA), and they fail at the task of restoring global structural integrity.

## üî¨ Interactive and Reproducible Experiment
This repository is designed for open science and full reproducibility. You can run the paper's complete pipeline (loading the connectome, simulating the hub attack, and comparing the therapies) in the following Google Colab notebook.

**Complete Validation Pipeline**
Run the large-scale experiment to validate how ORT-THERAPY-F (GCA) repairs the damaged connectome and why the baselines (PA and CN) fail.
