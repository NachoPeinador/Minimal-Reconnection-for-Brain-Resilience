        "## 🔬 Core Experiment: Comparison of Therapies under Targeted Attack (v8.3)\n",
        "This code cell executes the fundamental experiment described in the paper. The objective is to empirically validate the effectiveness of our proposed heuristic, ORT-THERAPY-F (GCA), by directly comparing it against standard baselines (PA and CN) in a realistic damage scenario.\n",
        "\n",
        "The experiment follows the methodology described in Section 2 (Experimental Methodology) of the paper:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Network Loading:** The healthy connectome (`bn-human-BNU_1...`) is loaded, and its giant component is extracted.\n",
        "* **Damage Simulation (Hub Attack):** The \"Targeted Link Attack\" model (function `alzheimer_targeted_attack_model`) is applied, as described in Section 2.1. This model simulates the hub vulnerability hypothesis by preferentially removing links that connect high-degree nodes. The result is a severely fragmented network, which serves as our **\"Pre-Therapy\" state**.\n",
        "* **Application of Therapies:** On this damaged network, we apply the three repair strategies (described in Section 2.2), each with an identical connection budget:\n",
        "    * **ORT-THERAPY-F (GCA):** Our proposed heuristic (function `evidence_based_therapy`) that implements \"Giant Component Absorption.\"\n",
        "    * **Baselines (PA and CN):** Traditional link prediction methods (function `lp_therapy`) which, according to our hypothesis, are optimized for densification and not for reconnection.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Hypothesis and Expected Results\n",
        "In accordance with the paper's central thesis (Sections 3 and 4), we expect the results from this cell to demonstrate:\n",
        "\n",
        "* A **total failure** of Preferential Attachment (PA) and Common Neighbors (CN) for the reconnection task (i.e., a `Component_Reduction` of 0).\n",
        "* A **total success** of ORT-THERAPY-F (GCA), which should reduce the number of components to 1, demonstrating superior efficiency and effectiveness.\n",
        "\n",
        "The cell will generate a final results table, analogous to Table 1 in the paper, comparing key effectiveness metrics (`Component_Reduction`, `Resilience_Gain`) and efficiency metrics (`Time` and `Connections_used`).\n",
        "\n",
        "## 💾 Action Required: Download and Upload the Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "For this experiment to work, you need the human connectome dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **ACTION REQUIRED:** To run this notebook, download the dataset from [The Network Data Repository](https://networkrepository.com/bn-human-BNU-1-0025890-session-1.php) and upload the file `bn-human-BNU-1_0025890_session_1.edges` to the Colab environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Steps to upload the file in Colab:**\n",
        "1.  Click the 📁 folder icon on the left-hand side menu in Colab.\n",
        "2.  Click the \"Upload to session storage\" icon (a paper sheet with an upward arrow).\n",
        "3.  Select the `bn-human-BNU-1_0025890_session_1.edges` file that you downloaded.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once uploaded, you can proceed to run the code cell."

        "* **Failure of Baselines (PA and CN):** As hypothesized, both **Preferential Attachment** and **Common Neighbors** were completely ineffective for the reconnection task.\n",
        "    * Despite using their connection budget (1,564 and 1,445 respectively), they **did not reduce even a single component** (`Component_Reduction = 0`).\n",
        "    * This confirms the paper's thesis: these strategies are designed for densification (adding links within existing clusters) but are structurally incapable of \"finding\" and \"bridging\" isolated components.\n",

        "* **Total Success of ORT-THERAPY-F (GCA):** Our proposed heuristic (GCA) was extremely effective and efficient.\n",
        "    * **Total Efficacy:** It reduced the 994 components **down to just 1 component**, completely restoring global connectivity (`Component_Reduction = 993`).\n",
        "    * **Resource Efficiency:** It achieved this complete repair using only **993 connections**—exactly one for each isolated component that needed to be \"absorbed.\" This is **36.5% less** than the 1,564 budget allocated (and used by PA), demonstrating optimal resource efficiency.\n",
        "    * **Computational Efficiency:** It was significantly faster (`10.3s`) than the complex computation of Common Neighbors (`147.7s`).\n",

        "## Simulation Conclusion\n",
        "These numerical results are the direct source for **Table 1** in the paper. They empirically demonstrate the superiority of an explicit reconnection strategy (GCA) over generic link prediction methods (PA/CN) for the specific task of reversing network fragmentation."
